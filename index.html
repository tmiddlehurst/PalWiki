			<h4>Info</h4>
			<p>PAL is a legendary group of lads from the South of England, formed in London in late 2011. The original team sheet consisted of
				Alexander Anderson, Alexander Rowe, Harry Birch, Sam Harn, Theodore Isaac and Thomas Middlehurst. Sam self removed himself from
				the group in early 2012 during the great 'David Luiz Cycle' crisis. However, this is now a fond memory shared within the group
				and despite not hearing from Sam for over a year a facebook message planted the seeds of friendship again and Sam has since
				rejoined PAL and all of the banter that ensues.</p>
			<p>Charlie Broome became a member mid 2012, during the first summer where PAL really began to get going, this era was often known
				as the Golden era as it is also when Jacky (The meme demon) Dormer was enlisted. The Golden era was full of parties and and
				contains some very precious memories for PAL, the first PALathon along with numerous nights out led to this being a great time
				for all.</p>
			<p>The name PAL is a mystery and none one is able to provide any factual evidence to give reason for it being called so. An
				issue which has caused much confusion amongst members and admirers alike. A mystery that will likely live on for as long as
				time itself. </p>
