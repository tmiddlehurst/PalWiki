			<h4>Conception</h4>
			<p>PAL is a legendary group of lads from the South of England, formed in London in late 2011. The original team sheet consisted of
				Alexander Anderson, Alexander Rowe, Harry Birch, Sam Harn, Theodore Isaac and Thomas Middlehurst. Sam self removed himself from
				the group in early 2012 during the great 'David Luiz Cycle' crisis. However, this is now a fond memory shared within the group
				and despite not hearing from Sam for over a year a facebook message planted the seeds of friendship again and Sam has since
				rejoined PAL and all of the banter that ensues.</p>
			<p>Charlie Broome became a member mid 2012, during the first summer where PAL really began to get going, this era was often known
				as the Golden era as it is also when Jacky (The meme demon) Dormer was enlisted. The Golden era was full of parties and and
				contains some very precious memories for PAL, the first PALathon along with numerous nights out led to this being a great time
				for all.</p>
			<p>The name PAL is a mystery and none one is able to provide any factual evidence to give reason for it being called so. An
				issue which has caused much confusion amongst members and admirers alike. A mystery that will likely live on for as long as
				time itself. </p>

				<p style="color:black"><span style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold">PALathon #1</span> - The inaugral PALathon involved The Founding Members (minus Harn) and was an event of great significance.
					The day was separated into a mixture of both individual and team events. The main event for the day is known simply as, The
					Death Pasta. Anderson obviously lost this challenge and had his leg shaved for not even managing to eat a single piece of pasta
					 before running like a pussy boy to the sink.<br> Miraculously the heros of the challenge, Thee and Tomby managed to sit and
					 finish theyre entire bowls... Sudden death quickly ensued and the garden was adequately sprayed with greek yoghurt and sick with
					  PALathletes rolling around. It was not a pretty site. The second, and questionably worse part to this challenge, was held in
						the bathroom in the following hours and days and it is said this is where the popular card game 'Ring of Fire' aquired
						its name.</p>
